h1. About

Experiment with caching loadable files in a hash, so @Kernel#require@ works much faster. It should also works with RubyGems. Inspired by http://gist.github.com/234467

h1. Usage

<pre>
require "cached_require" # original Kernel#require
require "yaml"  # redefined Kernel#require, will take much longer because of getting data
require "rango" # redefined Kernel#require, should be very fast

$LOAD_PATH.unshift(File.dirname(__FILE__)) # will update the hash
</pre>

h1. Problems of Current Implementation

- Thread-safety
